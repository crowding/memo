\title{Memoize a function.}
\usage{
memo(fn, cache = lru_cache(5000), key = hybrid_key, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fn}{A function to wrap. It should be a pure function (i.e. it should
not cause side effects, and should not depend on any variables that may
change.) It should not be a nonstandard-evaluating function. All arguments
will be forced by the wrapper.}

\item{cache}{A cache to use. Defaults to a new instance of
\code{\link{lru_cache}}.  Caches may be shared between memoized functions.}

\item{key}{A hashing strategy. "\code{\link{digest_key}}".
Other values include "pointer_key" and "hybrid_key".}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed on to key.}
}
\description{
Memoize a function.

This package implements a cache that can be used to avoid repeated
computations of functions. The cache lookup is based on object
identity (i.e.  pointer equivalence) which is suited for functions
like accessors or other functions that are called repeatedly on the
same object.  Description of memo goes here.
